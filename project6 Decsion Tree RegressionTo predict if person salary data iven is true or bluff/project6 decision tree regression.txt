Unique point about this is we donâ€™t have to do feature scaling in decision tree and random forest regression
Dataset:
Here, I am using dataset of different positions and levels going from 1 to 10 and salary going from 45000 dollars to 1000000 dollars
For this we use Position and salary dataset
We are using simple dataset


Scenario:
The Human Resources department wants to hire someone
A person is offered a position with tedious interviews
Now we have to determine the salary expectation
Now the person is asking 160000 $
Now the person says, that I have earned the same in my previous position
The company need to at least meet the previous salary
The HR department wants us to determine if the statement is true or bluff
This will be determined using polynomial regression model to build previous salary of the candidate
Dataset: salaries of different companies from business analyst to CEO
Compare the salaries of different positions to this person designation and company



Assumptions:
According to the person Resume and Profile:
 On LinkedIn it shows the person has been a regional manager
this person has been manager for past 2 years
In this, now depending on person experience and designation the company considered the level of person to be 6.5
